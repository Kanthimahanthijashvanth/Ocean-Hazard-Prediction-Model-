# Ocean-Hazard-Prediction-Model-
SafeShore is a machine learning–powered project designed to predict and analyze ocean hazards such as floods, high tides, cyclones, and coastal risks. The goal is to provide an early-warning system and enhance marine and coastal safety using real-time data and AI-driven predictions.

🚀 Project Overview

Objective: Predict potential ocean hazards based on location, hazard type, and environmental data.

Approach: Uses supervised machine learning models trained on oceanographic, meteorological, and environmental datasets.

Output: Provides hazard predictions with classification (e.g., flood risk, cyclone risk, tidal surge) and confidence scores.

🔑 Features

🌍 Location-based input – Users can specify coastal regions.

⚠️ Hazard type selection – Flood, storm surge, cyclone, high tide, etc.

🖼️ Multimedia input – Supports image/video evidence for analysis (optional).

📊 ML-powered prediction – Model classifies risk severity levels.

🔔 Alert system – Early warnings for hazard-prone zones.

🛠️ Tech Stack
